Introduction

This project endeavours to conduct an in-depth analysis of Airbnb rental pricing in Sydney, utilizing a historical 
dataset obtained from Airbnb as of December 10, 2022. It should be noted that Airbnb, as a marketplace for 
transient and extended rentals, diverges significantly from the traditional short-term housing market like hotels
 in terms of complexity and flexibility. This, in turn, necessitates a more nuanced pricing strategy. In light of this,
 data analysis tools are deployed in constructing a model based on historical data, thus aiding hosts in 
understanding the price formation and devising strategies that optimize their returns. Accordingly, this research
 employs various machine learning techniques for predicting Airbnb rentals' nightly rates, thereby providing 
valuable guidance for hosts in pricing decisions and investors in gauging potential revenue streams. To ensure 
the predictive accuracy of the model, five distinct models are tested. The finalized model generated through 
this research is designed to assist hosts in predicting prices based on relevant input information. Additionally, 
this study elucidates business insights pertaining to variables that significantly influence pricingã€‚
